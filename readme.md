## projects can be viewed through the [website](https://olaven.github.io/sunday-funday/).

## managing projects 
* To manage the projects displayed on the webiste, you may either 
    * use the client by running ```node client.js``` (_recommend_)
    * update ```projects.json``` manually
* Project files are stored in ```./projects```
* Only files in ```projects.json``` are included on website 


## Todo
- [ ] finish client 
- [x] generate projects on website from projects.json
